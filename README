Ryan is nuts. Realy he is...

I've been hacking around with Java for 10+ years. I say "hacking" because its been more like bootstrapping code together rather than establishing any kind of mastery over the development process.

This Java Sandbox is my attempt to take a very simple code base and make sure I understand all of the key principles of the language and the tools involved in development.

Some thoughts for expansion:
- Adding tests
- How can we validate the input
- How can we expand how shapes are drawn
- Refactoring: are classes/variables named clear enough? How can they be renamed to clarify their purpose more?
- Right now we are limited to the Swing GUI library how can we expand it to allow the user to choose between Swing, AWT, or GWT
- What about having the user submit the values via the gui rather than the command line
- Can we use mouse events to adjust everything on the fly
